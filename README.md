Difference between Rust threads and POSIX threads

As you move to implement similar functionality in C using POSIX threads (pthreads), here are some key differences and points to consider:

Thread Management: In Rust, the thread::spawn function makes it easy to create and manage threads. In C, you'll use the pthread_create function to create threads, requiring you to provide a function pointer for the thread's start routine and manage thread identifiers (pthread_t) explicitly.

Data Sharing and Synchronization: Rust's Mutex and Arc provide high-level abstractions for thread synchronization and shared ownership. In C, you'll use POSIX mutexes (pthread_mutex_t) for synchronization. Remember to initialize mutexes before use and lock (pthread_mutex_lock) and unlock (pthread_mutex_unlock) them appropriately to protect shared data.

Static Global Variables: Your use of lazy_static for safe initialization of a global mutable array in Rust needs a different approach in C. Global variables can be defined outside of any function (at the file level), and since C doesn't enforce the same level of safety as Rust, you'll directly operate on global arrays. However, you must still synchronize access to shared data using mutexes to prevent data races.

Memory Management: Rust automatically manages memory for you, ensuring safety. In C, you'll need to be mindful of memory allocation and deallocation, especially if your data processing involves dynamic memory management.

Error Handling: Rust's Result and Option types, along with the unwrap method, provide a way to handle errors and optionality safely. In C, you'll typically use return codes for error handling and must manually check these codes after operations, such as thread creation or mutex operations.
